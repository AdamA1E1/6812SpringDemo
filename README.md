# Home Credit

Predictive Risk Classification for Loan Eligibility

## Project Overview

Home Credit aims to expand access to fair lending, especially for clients with limited credit histories. Our project developed a predictive modeling pipeline to classify loan applicants by default risk, helping Home Credit make safer, more inclusive lending decisions.

## Our Solution

To address Home Credit’s challenge of assessing clients with limited credit history, we built a predictive modeling pipeline focused on improving financial inclusion and responsible lending decisions.

Our solution included:
  
  •	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values through median and mode imputation and ensuring data quality.
  
  •	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating feature distributions, target imbalance, and identifying impactful variables.

  •	Feature Engineering and Selection: Creating meaningful features and selecting the most relevant ones to improve model performance.

  •	Model Training and Evaluation: Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.

  •	Final Model Selection: Choosing Gradient Boosting based on its superior AUC score (.60 on validation data), which is more appropriate than accuracy given   the class imbalance.

Ultimately, our Gradient Boosting model offers a data-driven, deployable solution to predict defaults and guide lending decisions.

## My Contribution

Throughout the project, I actively contributed to several key areas:

  •	Modeling Work: I implemented Logistic Regression, experimented with multiple models, and tuned hyperparameters.

  •	Data Cleaning: Assisted in preprocessing steps to handle missing and inconsistent values.

  •	Exploratory Data Analysis: Led the EDA phase, identifying important trends and guiding feature selection strategies.
 
  •	Model Comparison and Selection: Collaborated closely with teammates to compare model performance using cross-validation   metrics like AUC.
 
  •	Presentation Development: Helped design and refine the final presentation to clearly communicate project outcomes and     next steps.

## Business Value

Our predictive model provides tangible value to Home Credit by:

  •	Improving Risk Assessment: By accurately identifying high-risk applicants, the model reduces loan defaults.

  •	Enhancing Financial Inclusion: Allows Home Credit to safely lend to underserved populations by leveraging alternative     data sources.
 
  •	Operational Efficiency: Automates part of the risk assessment process, saving time and reducing manual evaluation errors.
 
  •	Cost Savings: Based on our model's AUC performance, Home Credit could expect a measurable reduction in default rates,     potentially saving significant financial losses.

This solution strengthens Home Credit’s mission of expanding access to credit while maintaining portfolio quality.

## Difficulties Encountered

Several challenges arose during the project:
1.	Class Imbalance: Default cases were rare compared to non-defaults.

    o	Solution: Focused on AUC as the main evaluation metric, instead of accuracy, to fairly assess model performance.

3.	Missing Data: Many important features contained substantial missing values.

     o	Solution: Carefully imputed missing data using median (numeric) and mode (categorical) strategies to avoid bias.

4.	High Dimensionality: The dataset had a large number of features with complex relationships.

    o	Solution: Used tree-based models like Gradient Boosting that can handle many features effectively.

6.	Feature Interpretability: Understanding what features influenced predictions was complex.

     o	Solution: Applied SHAP value analysis and feature importance plots to improve model explainability.

7.	Computational Limits: Training large models was resource-intensive.

    o	Solution: Performed hyperparameter optimization and used efficient algorithms to balance model complexity and runtime.

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights and growth opportunities:

  •	Building Machine Learning Pipelines: End-to-end experience from raw data to model deployment.

  •	Managing Imbalanced Data: Learned how to choose appropriate metrics like AUC and use resampling strategies.

  •	Real-world Financial Applications: Gained a deeper understanding of how machine learning can impact credit risk  decisions and financial inclusion.

 •	Team Collaboration: Enhanced skills in coordinating work on GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and sharing modeling insights.  

 •	Model Interpretability and Ethics: Learned the importance of explaining machine learning predictions, especially when they affect people's financial lives.

This experience strengthened both my technical modeling skills and my understanding of business-driven data science.
